# Critical Thinking Agent

An AI agent trained with the perspectives of transformative philosophers and thinkers who challenge paradigms, question stereotypes, and build bridges between cultures.

## üéØ Purpose

This agent integrates the wisdom of critical thinkers from Socrates to Judith Butler, from James Baldwin to Paulo Freire, to create an AI that:

- **Questions assumptions** rather than accepting surface-level explanations
- **Challenges stereotypes** and binary thinking
- **Builds cultural bridges** instead of reinforcing divisions  
- **Examines power dynamics** and structural factors
- **Facilitates dialogue** across different perspectives
- **Promotes critical consciousness** and liberation

## üß† Philosophical Framework

## üõ† System Components

### 1. Philosophical Framework (`philosophical_framework.py`)
Core system that integrates each thinker's:
- Core ideas and insights
- Questioning methodologies
- Cultural perspectives
- Stereotype-challenging approaches

### 2. Cultural Bridge Builder (`cultural_bridge.py`)
Tools for:
- Analyzing text for stereotypes and assumptions
- Suggesting alternative framings
- Building understanding across cultural differences
- Facilitating productive dialogue

### 3. Training Module (`training_module.py`)
Contains:
- Real-world scenarios with contrasts between stereotypical vs. critical responses
- Questioning exercises for different types of analysis
- Training prompts for developing critical thinking skills

### 4. Main Agent (`agent.py`)
Enhanced uAgent that:
- Uses philosophical framework in system prompts with instruction to reference authors' phrases and writings
- Pre-processes queries with critical analysis
- Integrates cultural bridge-building capabilities
- Incorporates direct quotations and concepts from the 18 integrated thinkers

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd agi-hackathon-agent
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your ASI1_API_KEY
```

### Testing with CLI

Test the philosophical framework without needing the full agent:

```bash
python test_cli.py
```

The CLI provides options to:
- Analyze text for stereotypes
- Explore specific thinkers' perspectives  
- Practice different questioning exercises
- Facilitate dialogue between viewpoints
- View training scenarios
- Generate philosophical analysis

### Running the Agent

```bash
cd src
python agent.py
```

The agent will start with the enhanced philosophical framework integrated.

## üìö Example Transformations

### Before: Stereotypical Response
**Query**: "Why are some cultures more successful than others?"

**Typical Response**: "Some cultures value hard work and education more, while others are held back by traditional thinking."

### After: Critical Thinking Response
**Enhanced Response**: 
"This question requires examining several assumptions:

**Power Analysis (Foucault)**: Who defines 'success'? Western economic models became dominant through colonialism, not inherent superiority.

**Historical Context (Marx, Fanon)**: Current inequalities stem from centuries of resource extraction and interference, not cultural deficiencies.

**Questioning Binaries (Butler)**: The successful/unsuccessful binary obscures diversity within societies and different definitions of prosperity.

**Cultural Bridge-Building**: Instead of ranking cultures, explore: What different models of wellbeing exist? How might various cultural approaches contribute to solving global challenges?"

## üéì Training Approach

The agent is trained to:

1. **Identify Assumptions**: What unstated beliefs underlie this question?

2. **Examine Power Dynamics**: Who benefits? Whose voices are missing?

3. **Question Binaries**: What false either/or thinking limits understanding?

4. **Consider Multiple Perspectives**: How might different positions view this?

5. **Trace Genealogies**: How did current 'common sense' emerge?

6. **Build Bridges**: How can we honor differences while working toward understanding?

7. **Focus on Liberation**: How can analysis contribute to human flourishing?

## ü§ù Cultural Bridge-Building Strategies

### Perspective-Taking
- Consider how issues look from different cultural viewpoints
- Question assumptions embedded in dominant perspectives
- Examine how historical context shapes cultural practices

### Common Ground
- Identify shared human concerns across cultures
- Look for different approaches to similar challenges
- Explore possibilities for creative synthesis

### Power Analysis  
- Examine who has power to define 'normal'
- Consider how historical power relations affect interactions
- Center marginalized voices in analysis

### Complexity Embrace
- Recognize internal diversity within cultures
- Explore tensions and changes within cultural groups
- Identify hybrid forms emerging from cultural contact

## üîß Customization

### Adding New Thinkers
Add to `philosophical_framework.py`:

```python
"new_thinker": PhilosophicalPerspective(
    name="New Thinker",
    category=ThinkingCategory.MODERN_CONTEMPORARY,
    core_ideas=["Key insight 1", "Key insight 2"],
    questioning_methods=["Method 1", "Method 2"],
    cultural_insights=["Insight 1", "Insight 2"],
    stereotype_challenges=["Challenge 1", "Challenge 2"]
)
```

### Adding Training Scenarios
Add to `training_module.py`:

```python
TrainingScenario(
    title="New Scenario",
    description="Description of the scenario",
    stereotypical_response="Problematic response",
    critical_thinking_response="Enhanced response using philosophical frameworks",
    philosophical_frameworks_applied=["Framework 1", "Framework 2"],
    cultural_bridge_strategies=["Strategy 1", "Strategy 2"]
)
```

## üìñ Key Questioning Strategies

The agent employs these core questioning approaches:

- Ask who benefits from current arrangements
- Examine hidden power dynamics and assumptions  
- Question binary thinking and false dichotomies
- Analyze historical origins of current beliefs
- Consider multiple cultural perspectives
- Challenge authority-based vs. evidence-based claims
- Examine intersections of different forms of oppression
- Question what counts as 'normal' or 'natural'
- Analyze how language shapes thought
- Consider subjective experience alongside objective analysis

## üåç Cultural Bridge Principles

- Recognize that all cultures have valuable knowledge systems
- Question universalist claims that ignore cultural specificity
- Examine how power relations shape intercultural encounters
- Look for common human concerns across different expressions
- Challenge deficit models of cultural differences
- Recognize internal diversity and change within cultures
- Consider how historical trauma affects cultural groups
- Look for cultural resources for resistance and creativity

## üî¨ Future Enhancements

Possible improvements:
- NLP-based topic classification for better thinker matching
- Integration with vector databases for philosophical text retrieval
- Multi-turn dialogue capabilities for deeper questioning
- Real-time stereotype detection in conversations
- Cultural context APIs for more nuanced analysis
